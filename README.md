# Transformation Golf

An educational game for exploring the effects of translations, rotations and reflections of a triangle in the coordinate plane.

## Indiana DOE Math Standards

8.GM.1 Explore dilations, translations, rotations, and reflections on two-dimensional figures in the coordinate plane. 

G.TS.1 Use geometric descriptions of rigid motions to transform figures and to predict and describe the results of translations, reflections and rotations on a given figure. Describe a motion or a series of motions that will show two shapes are congruent.
